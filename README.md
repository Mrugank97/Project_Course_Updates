### **Research Papers Studied:**  

1. **Backdoor Attacks on LSTM-Based Text Classification**  
   - **Summary:** Implements a stealthy backdoor in text classification models using data poisoning, achieving a 95% attack success rate.  
   - **Date Studied:** 18th January 2025
   - **[Link To Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.12457)** 

2. **Targeted Attack on Black-Box Neural Machine Translation**  
   - **Summary:** Demonstrates that NMT systems can be attacked via parallel data poisoning, achieving over 50% success rate with minimal poisoning budgets.  
   - **Date Studied:** 24th January 2025
   - **[Link To Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.00675)** 

3. **Backdoor Attacks on Multilingual Machine Translation**  
   - **Summary:** Highlights how poisoning low-resource language pairs can impact high-resource translations, exposing vulnerabilities in multilingual systems.  
   - **Date Studied:** 26th January 2025
   - **[Link To Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02393)**

5. **Beyond Aesthetics - Cultural Competence in Text-to-Image Models**  
   - **Summary:** Introduces a framework to evaluate cultural competence in T2I models along two dimensionsâ€”cultural awareness and cultural diversity. The study presents CUBE, a benchmark covering cultural artifacts across eight countries and three concepts (cuisine, landmarks, and art), and highlights significant gaps in cultural awareness in current T2I models.

6. **ViSAGe: A Global-Scale Analysis of Visual Stereotypes in Text-to-Image Generation**  
   - **Summary:** Introduces the ViSAGe dataset for evaluating nationality-based stereotypes in T2I models across 135 nationalities. Finds that generated images reinforce stereotypes, with stronger biases in depictions of identities from the Global South.  
   - **Date Studied:** 4th February 
   - **[Link To Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06310)**


7. **BackdoorMBTI Benchmark**  
   - **Summary:** Introduces a multimodal toolkit for backdoor defense evaluation, providing a systematic pipeline for assessing backdoor robustness across different modalities.  
   - **Date Studied:**  14th February 2025
